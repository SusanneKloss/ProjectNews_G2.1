Exception handling at first push into main (29.05. around 16.10):
- NewsApi:
getNews(String url) throws NewsApiException -> wrapped IOException for execute(), (NullPointer for string(), JSONSyntaxException for url ="")
- AppController:
getTopHeadlinesAustria() throws NewsApiException: with comments, exception propagated from NewsApi to Menu
getAllNewsBitcoin() throws NewsApiException: just code, exception propagated from NewsApi to Menu
- Menu:
getArticleCount():
new CustomException for case outputList == null
other cases (0, !=null) handled as well
getTopHeadlinesAustria():
final catch of propagated custom wrapped IOException from NewsApi
new CustomException for case outputList == null
other cases (0, !=null) handled as well
getAllNewsBitcoin():
code like in getTopHeadlinesAustria(), comments not cleaned up
